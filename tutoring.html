        <h2>Updated News About My Tutoring Services</h2>
        <h3>March 12th: I offer mathematics course tutoring in three different ways, all of which are free of charge!</h3>

        <p>1. Through the Learn To Be organization (you must create an account to receive tutoring from me). <p>
        <p>2. You can email me to request private tutoring; however, there is no guarantee that I will accept the request due to my overcommitted schedule this year. <p>
        <p>3. You can participate in my asynchronous tutoring sessions, where lecture videos will be posted online, and I can send you homework problems. <p>
        
        <p>In Learn To Be, you will be able to see my available times; however, for private tutoring, you will likely need to check with me to find a time that works for both of us.</p>

        <h3>March 12th: Updated Progress on Vegas Gambler's Dilemma Theory</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances and the loss of team members during the development of my first research paper on Geometrical Probability, Game Theory, and Statistics, my remaining teammates and I have decided not to publish it. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. However, we are excited to announce that we will soon be starting our second research paper, which will primarily focus on geometry, with potential elements of number theory and topology</p>
